## Project Structure

This application facilitates user authentication via email login, enabling users to access various features such as creating and editing posts. Leveraging MongoDB as the backend database, user creation is managed through Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool designed for Node.js.

The core functionalities of this application include:

- **User Authentication**: Users can securely log in using their email credentials, ensuring personalized experiences and data security.

- **Post Creation and Editing**: Authenticated users can create new posts and edit existing ones, enhancing user engagement and content management within the platform.

- **Profile Page**: Each user has a dedicated profile page where they can view details of their activity, including the posts they have created. This feature enhances user engagement and facilitates personalization.

- **Feed Page**: Users can browse through a feed of posts created by other users, fostering community interaction and content discovery. Clicking on posts enables users to view the profile of the respective post creator.
